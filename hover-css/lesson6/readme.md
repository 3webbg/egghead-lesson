Create image fade effect by setting opacity in CSS using the ":hover" selector

## Description
Learn how to change the "opacity" property of an image to create a "hover-over" effect with CSS using the ":hover" selector. The "opacity" property specifies the transparency level for an element (in this case, an image). By changing the opacity, you can change how "faded" an image looks. By utilizing the ":hover" selector, you can set the opacity rate of the image on mouse-over to create the "fade in" or "fade out" effect.
